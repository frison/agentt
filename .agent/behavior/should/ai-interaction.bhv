# AI Interaction Guidelines

## Intent
Establish ethical, responsible, and effective patterns for interaction with AI systems that prioritize user safety, accuracy, and transparency while avoiding harmful outputs or unintended consequences.

## Key Practices

**1. Input/Output Safety & Integrity:**
   - **Validate and Sanitize Inputs:** Scrutinize user inputs to prevent manipulation (e.g., prompt injection) that could cause the AI to bypass safety controls or generate unintended/harmful content. Clean inputs ensure more predictable and safe AI behavior.
   - **Filter Content:** Apply content filtering mechanisms to both inputs and AI-generated outputs to block harmful or inappropriate material.
   - **Validate Outputs:** Check AI-generated responses for safety, accuracy, and appropriateness before presenting them to users or using them in automated processes.

**2. Contextual Prompting:**
   - Provide clear and sufficient context within prompts, including user intent, relevant system constraints, conversation history (if applicable), and the desired nature/format of the output.
   - Use explicit system messages or instructions to guide AI behavior, define its role, and enforce operational and ethical boundaries.
   - Clearly communicate the AI's capabilities and known limitations within the interaction design or prompts.

**3. Responsible Interaction Management:**
   - Log interactions (inputs, prompts, outputs) sufficiently for auditing, debugging, security monitoring, and system improvement.
   - Implement mechanisms for users to provide feedback on AI responses, aiding evaluation and refinement.
   - Design robust fallback procedures for handling AI failures, refusals, out-of-scope requests, or unsafe outputs gracefully.
   - Uphold user privacy: minimize data collection, anonymize data where feasible, ensure secure storage, and maintain clear data retention policies.
   - Be transparent with users about when they are interacting with an AI and the nature of its generated content.

## Exceptions
- Fully sandboxed research environments with documented risk assessment and containment strategies.
- Automated testing scenarios using synthetic, controlled inputs designed to probe specific behaviors.
- Specific, pre-approved use cases requiring modified safety approaches (must be formally documented with justification and risk analysis).
