# AI Data Transfer Optimization Practice

## Core Statement

Design interactions providing data to AI agents to minimize irrelevant or excessive data transfer, optimizing for token limits, cost, and processing time.

## Rationale

LLMs have input constraints and processing costs. Sending only necessary, structured information reduces cost, improves response time, avoids context limits, and increases focus.

## Applications

- **Selective Retrieval:** Enable requesting data subsets via flags/parameters.
- **Filtering:** Implement effective filtering (e.g., by tags) for relevance.
- **Structure:** Prefer structured formats (JSON) over unstructured text.
- **Conciseness:** Avoid verbose text intended for AI consumption.
- **Summarization:** Provide summaries; allow requesting details on demand.
- **Minimize Redundancy:** Avoid repeating information within a response.
- **Balance Round Trips:** Weigh response size vs. number of interactions.
- **Design for Purpose:** Tailor data structure/content to the AI task.
