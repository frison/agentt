# Guidance File Conventions Practice

## Core Statement

Guidance files (`.bhv`, `.rcp`) must follow consistent naming and structural conventions to facilitate organization, discovery, and maintenance.

## Rationale

Standard conventions reduce ambiguity and cognitive load when navigating, creating, or referencing guidance. They ensure tools can reliably parse and process these files.

## Applications

- **File Naming:**
    *   **Format:** Use lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`-`).
    *   **Structure:** Prefer `Scope-Topic.extension` (e.g., `cli-config-management.bhv`, `git-commit-creation.rcp`). Grouping by primary scope (cli, git, meta) often aids organization.
    *   **Conciseness:** Keep names descriptive but reasonably concise.
    *   **Extension:** Use `.bhv` for behaviors and `.rcp` for recipes.
- **Directory Structure:**
    *   Organize behaviors under `.agent/behavior/` (split by `must`/`should`)
    *   Organize recipes under `.agent/cookbook/`.
    *   Use subdirectories based on scope/domain (e.g., `meta/`, `cli/`, `git/`) within `behavior/` and `cookbook/` for better organization.
- **Frontmatter:**
    *   All guidance files MUST start with valid YAML frontmatter enclosed in `---` delimiters.
    *   Include required keys: `title` (string), `description` (string), `priority` (integer), `tags` (array of strings).
    *   Behaviors MUST include `tier: must` or `tier: should`.
    *   Tags MUST follow `guidance-tagging-conventions` (using `key:value` format).
- **Content Structure:**
    *   Use Markdown for the body content after the frontmatter.
    *   Start with `# Title` matching the frontmatter title.
    *   Include `## Core Statement` and `## Rationale` sections for behaviors.
    *   Use `## Applications` (for behaviors) or `## Steps` / specific procedural headings (for recipes).
    *   Maintain clarity and conciseness throughout.
- **Linking/References:**
    *   When referencing other guidance entities (e.g., in `related_guidance` frontmatter or via links in the body), use the canonical entity ID (typically derived from the filename without extension) for robustness.
