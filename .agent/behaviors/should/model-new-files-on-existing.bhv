title: Model New Files on Existing Files
description: When creating new files, use existing files of the same type or within the same context, preferably ones recently committed and known to be well-structured, as a structural template. This helps ensure format and structural consistency.

# Model New Files on Existing Files

## Core Principle
To maintain structural and format consistency across the codebase, new files should generally be based on the structure of existing files of the same type or within a similar context.

## Rationale
Using existing, well-formed files as templates reduces the likelihood of formatting errors, missing required structural elements, or inconsistent organization. This leverages the collective validation and refinement already applied to the existing codebase.

## Application
- Before creating a new file (e.g., source code, configuration, documentation), examine a few existing files of the same kind or in the same module/directory to understand the expected structure, formatting conventions, and common patterns.
- Copy the structure of a relevant existing file as a starting point.
- Pay attention to required elements, naming conventions, and established patterns within that specific context.
- While content will differ, the basic file structure and organization should align with established norms for that type of file in the project.
