# Git Commit Message Format

## Intent
Establish a consistent, informative commit message structure that effectively communicates changes, reasoning, and context to maintain a useful and navigable project history.

## Rules
- Structure all commit messages with these components:
  1. Title (REQUIRED):
     - 50 characters maximum
     - Imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
     - Capitalize first word
     - No period at end
     - Concise summary of the change

  2. Body (REQUIRED):
     - Blank line after title
     - 72 characters per line
     - Explain what changed and why
     - **Note:** When constructing multi-line bodies in shell commands, ensure newlines are correctly interpreted (e.g., using `printf`, ANSI-C quoting `$'...'`, or heredocs) rather than being treated as literal `\\n`.
     - Use markdown formatting
     - Focus on motivation and context

  3. Footer (OPTIONAL):
     - Reference issues/PRs
     - Add metadata tags
     - One item per line

- For agent annotations, add:
  ```
  -- Agent annotation

  Context and Decisions:
  <key technical decisions>

  Sentiment and Commentary:
  <tone and motivation analysis>
  ```

- Always preserve the following in commit messages:
  - Original commit message when amending
  - Emoji if present
  - Referenced issue numbers
  - Co-author credits

## Examples
```
Add user authentication to API

Implement JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
This change is required for GDPR compliance and improves
overall system security.

Refs: #123, #456
Security: High

-- Agent annotation

Context and Decisions:
- Chose JWT for stateless authentication
- Implemented in middleware layer
- Added rate limiting for security

Sentiment and Commentary:
- Security-focused implementation
- Proactive compliance approach
- Strong emphasis on best practices
```

## Exceptions
- Automated commits (merge commits, version bumps)
- Temporary WIP commits that will be squashed
- Initial repository setup commits
