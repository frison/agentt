# Agent Interaction via agentt CLI

This CLI tool allows interaction with the agent guidance definitions
without needing the HTTP server.

## Standard Interaction Flow:

1.  **Fetch Summary:**
    Run the command:
    ```bash
    agentt summary
    ```
    This will output a JSON array containing summaries for all available
    behaviors and recipes. Each summary includes:
    - id: Unique identifier (e.g., "bhv-safety-first", "rcp-git-commit-creation")
    - type: "behavior" or "recipe"
    - tier: "must" or "should" (for behaviors)
    - tags: Associated tags
    - description: A brief description

2.  **Identify Relevant IDs:**
    Analyze the JSON output from step 1. Based on the current task or
    context, identify the IDs of the behaviors and recipes that are relevant.

3.  **Fetch Full Details:**
    Run the command, providing the relevant IDs using the --id flag
    (repeat the flag for multiple IDs):
    ```bash
    agentt details --id <relevant_id_1> --id <relevant_id_2> ...
    ```
    Example:
    ```bash
    agentt details --id bhv-safety-first --id rcp-git-commit-creation
    ```
    This will output a JSON array containing the full details (including
    the body/content) for only the specified entities.

4.  **Proceed with Task:**
    Use the full details obtained in step 3 to guide the execution of
    the task, adhering to the MUST behaviors and considering SHOULD
    behaviors and relevant recipes.

This two-step process (summary first, then specific details) is designed
to be more efficient than fetching all details upfront.
