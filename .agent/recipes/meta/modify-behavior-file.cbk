# Recipe: Modify Behavior File

This recipe guides the process of safely modifying an existing behavior file (`.agent/behavior/*.bhv`).

## Steps

1.  **Identify Target File:**
    *   Ask the user to specify the exact path to the `.bhv` file they want to modify (relative to the project root).
    *   Example: `.agent/behavior/must/separation-of-concerns.bhv`

2.  **Read Current Content:**
    *   Use the `read_file` tool to read the *entire* content of the specified `.bhv` file. This ensures full context.

3.  **Confirm Change with User:**
    *   Present the current content to the user.
    *   Ask the user to provide the *exact* changes they want to make. Request they provide the changes in a format suitable for the `edit_file` tool (using `// ... existing code ...` or similar context markers if necessary).

4.  **Apply Change:**
    *   Carefully construct the `code_edit` parameter for the `edit_file` tool based *only* on the user's specified changes and necessary context.
    *   Use the `edit_file` tool to propose the changes to the target `.bhv` file.
    *   Set the `instructions` parameter for `edit_file` to clearly state which behavior file is being modified and summarize the change (e.g., "Modify priority in separation-of-concerns.bhv").

5.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   After the edit is applied, consider re-reading the file using `read_file` to confirm the change was applied as expected.
    *   Inform the user of the outcome.
