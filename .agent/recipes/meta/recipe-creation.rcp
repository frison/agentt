# Recipe Guidelines

## Required Sequence
1. STOP - Do not proceed until completing these steps
2. Read this recipe guidance completely
3. Follow modification sequence below
4. Verify changes maintain explicitness

## Agentic Modifications
- Never skip prerequisites section
- Never remove explicit behavioral directives
- When updating recipes, maintain or increase explicitness
- Document reasoning for recipe changes in commit messages
- Follow modification sequence:
  1. Verify current directory is project root
  2. Make required changes
  3. Verify changes maintain explicitness
  4. Document changes in commit message

## Structure
- Clear title (imperative mood)
- Numbered steps (not paragraphs)
- Prerequisites section (required)
- Minimal explanation
- Code blocks when needed
- No redundancy

## Prerequisites
- MUST check this recipe before creating or modifying any recipes
- MUST start all operations from project root (parent of .agent/ directory)
- Always include this section
- List required knowledge/tools/files
- Link related behavior directives: `[Behavior Title](../../behavior/path/to/directive.bhv)`
- Link related recipes: `[Recipe Title](../path/to/recipe.rcp)`
- List dependencies on other recipes
- Keep list brief, only essential items

## Directory Context
- ALL recipes MUST start from project root directory
- Project root is the parent directory of .agent/
- Use `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)` to ensure root context
- All paths MUST be relative to project root
- Document any temporary directory changes within steps
- Return to project root after any directory changes

## Format
- YAML frontmatter: Use `---` delimiters. Key fields identified by `discover.sh` include:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (string).
  - `title`: Human-readable title (string).
  - `priority`: Execution/recommendation priority (integer).
  - `description`: Critical statement used for agentic discovery (string).
  - `tags`: List of relevant keywords (list of strings).
  - `domain`: Functional area (e.g., "git", "blog") (string, optional).
  - `related_guidance`: Links to related behaviors (map, optional).
  - `calls_recipes`: List of other recipe IDs this recipe uses (list of strings, optional).
  - `path`: Path to the recipe file (automatically added by discovery).
  - `applies_to_paths`: Glob patterns for files this recipe applies to (list of strings, optional).
  - `tools_required`: List of tools needed (list of strings, optional).
- Use H1 for title, H2 for sections

## Content
- Only include critical steps
- Eliminate all unnecessary text
- Focus on actions, not theory
- Use direct commands
- Include only essential examples
- For git operations, follow [Git History Preservation](../git/git-history-preservation.rcp)

## Maintenance
- Remove outdated content
- Combine related recipes
- Split complex recipes
