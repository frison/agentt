# Recipe: Blog Post Collaboration

## Prerequisites
- Working in the blog/content directory
- Understanding of Markdown syntax
- Clear topic idea for the post
- Get the current date with `date +%Y-%m-%d`

## File Naming Convention
1. For regular blog posts:
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-in-kebab-case.md`
   - Example: `2023-03-29-get-a-firebase-token-the-easy-way.md`
2. For special pages:
   - Use simple descriptive name: `about.md`, `contact.md`

## Phase 1: Post Request & Setup
1. User provides:
   - Specific topic
   - Initial thoughts or random meanderings
   - Any specific sections they want covered
2. AI validates topic and file naming
3. AI creates new file with correct naming pattern
4. AI generates frontmatter:
   ```md
   ---
   title: "Post Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   draft: true
   ---
   ```

## Phase 2: Outline Creation
1. AI creates structured outline:
   - Main headings (H2)
   - Subheadings where appropriate (H3)
   - Bullet points under each section
   - No detailed content yet
2. AI presents outline for review
3. User approves or requests changes
4. Iterate until outline is approved

## Phase 3: Collaborative Writing
1. User writes content following outline
2. AI provides real-time commentary:
   - Technical insights
   - Witty observations
   - Engineering-focused perspective
   - Constructive suggestions
3. AI maintains salty, funny, but professional tone
4. Continue until post is complete

## Notes
- Keep AI commentary relevant to engineering context
- Maintain consistent voice throughout collaboration
- Preserve user's original ideas and style
- Focus on technical accuracy while keeping it entertaining
