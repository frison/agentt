# Git Repository Import and History Preservation

## Required Sequence
1. STOP - Do not proceed until completing these steps
2. Verify you are in project root directory
3. Check all prerequisites are met
4. Follow steps in exact order
5. Verify results after completion

## Prerequisites
- STOP - Verify project root directory before ANY operations
- Git installed and configured
- SSH access to target repositories
- Read [Shell Commands](004-core-C_U_-shell-commands.mdc)
- Read [Writing for Public Consumption](900-core-C_U_-writing-for-public-consumption.mdc)

## Directory Context
1. MUST be in project root (parent of .cursor/)
2. Verify:
   ```bash
   test -d .cursor || { echo "Not in project root"; exit 1; }
   ```
3. Required paths (all relative to root):
   - `.agent/cookbook/git/bin/`: Location for supporting scripts (like the one used in this recipe)
   - `hippocampus/`: Memory storage (REQUIRED)

## Steps
1. Verify prerequisites (REQUIRED):
   ```bash
   test -d .cursor || { echo "Not in project root"; exit 1; }
   test -x .agent/cookbook/git/bin/git-history-preservation.sh || {
       echo "❌ History preservation script not found or not executable"
       exit 1
   }
   ```

2. Import repository (REQUIRED):
   ```bash
   # For read-only imports
   .agent/cookbook/git/bin/git-history-preservation.sh <source_repo_url> <destination_dir>

   # For auto-committed imports
   AGENTT_PERMIT_COMMIT=true .agent/cookbook/git/bin/git-history-preservation.sh <source_repo_url> <destination_dir>
   ```

3. Verify results (REQUIRED):
   - Destination directory exists with files
   - No `.git` directory in imported code
   - Provenance archive exists
   - Commit message contains provenance (if auto-committed)

## Script Behavior (formerly Sacred Script)
1. Verifies project root context (REQUIRED)
2. Validates branch permissions (REQUIRED)
3. Creates hippocampus archive (REQUIRED)
4. Cleans git metadata (REQUIRED)
5. Generates standardized commit messages (REQUIRED)
6. Maintains directory structure (REQUIRED)

## Common Mistakes
❌ NEVER:
- Skip project root verification
- Use absolute paths
- Import repositories manually
- Bypass the script
- Import from non-permitted branches
- Delete memories from the hippocampus
- Edit imported code before committing
- Modify provided URLs

✅ ALWAYS:
- Verify project root first
- Use relative paths
- Use the script
- Check results
- Maintain archives
- Document issues

## Example
```bash
# REQUIRED - Verify project root
test -d .cursor || { echo "Not in project root"; exit 1; }

# Import repository
.agent/cookbook/git/bin/git-history-preservation.sh git@github.com:user/repo.git cortex_input
```

## Maintenance
- Keep the script up to date
- Update example URLs as needed
- Document new common mistakes
- Monitor and update branch permissions

## Important Note
The script defined in this recipe is the ONLY approved method for importing external repositories with history preservation as described. This is not a suggestion - it is a requirement. Any attempts to bypass this process will result in non-compliant imports that must be reverted and redone properly.
