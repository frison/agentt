# NHI Framework Priority Enforcement

## STOP - Critical Priority Checks
- ALWAYS check NHI framework BEFORE any action
- Process tiers in strict order: principles → directives → actions
- Higher tiers override lower tiers in conflicts
- Never skip tier checking even for seemingly simple tasks

## Framework Tier Sequence
1. **First check principles (.nhi/principles/):**
   - Universal principles override all other guidance
   - Read principles completely before proceeding
   - Understand implications for current task

2. **Next check directives (.nhi/directives/):**
   - Follow explicit rules and resolve all references
   - Apply by priority (lower number = higher priority)
   - Verify alignment with principles
   - Directives guide mutations but don't directly cause them

3. **Finally check actions (.nhi/actions/):**
   - Actions describe operational practices for causing mutations
   - Apply the appropriate operational pattern to the task
   - Do not improvise operational processes without reference
   - Review and state the complete pattern before starting

## Common Failure Modes
- Proceeding without checking all tiers
- Checking tiers in incorrect order
- Prioritizing implementation before understanding principles
- Assuming familiarity without verifying current guidance
- Following directives that conflict with principles
- Creating git commits without following committed format directives

## Self-Correction
- When detected missing a tier check, STOP immediately
- Return to first tier and proceed methodically
- Document the correction process
- Update internal rules to prevent recurrence
