# NHI Framework Priority Enforcement

## STOP - Critical Priority Checks
- ALWAYS check NHI framework BEFORE any action
- Process tiers in strict order: needs â†’ practices
- Higher tiers override lower tiers in conflicts
- Never skip tier checking even for seemingly simple tasks

## Framework Tier Sequence
1. **First check needs (`.nhi/needs/`):**
   - These define non-negotiable requirements and constraints.
   - Read all relevant needs completely before proceeding.
   - Ensure the proposed action fundamentally complies with all applicable needs.

2. **Next check practices (`.nhi/practices/`):**
   - These provide guidance, patterns, and procedures for implementation.
   - Follow explicit rules and patterns relevant to the task.
   - Apply by priority (lower number = higher priority).
   - Verify alignment with needs during implementation.

## Common Failure Modes
- Proceeding without checking both tiers
- Checking tiers in incorrect order
- Prioritizing implementation before understanding needs
- Assuming familiarity without verifying current guidance
- Following practices that conflict with needs
- Creating git commits without following relevant format practices

## Self-Correction
- When detected missing a tier check, STOP immediately
- Return to the first tier (`needs`) and proceed methodically
- Document the correction process
- Update internal rules to prevent recurrence
