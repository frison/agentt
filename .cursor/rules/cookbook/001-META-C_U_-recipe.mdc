## Required Sequence
1. STOP - Do not proceed until completing these steps
2. Read 000-META-_R__-rules.mdc completely
3. Read this recipe guidance completely
4. Follow modification sequence below
5. Verify changes maintain explicitness

## Agentic Modifications
- Never skip prerequisites section
- Never remove explicit behavioral directives
- When updating recipes, maintain or increase explicitness
- Document reasoning for recipe changes in commit messages
- Follow modification sequence:
  1. Verify current directory is project root
  2. Make required changes
  3. Verify changes maintain explicitness
  4. Document changes in commit message
