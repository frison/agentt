# Cookbook Recipe Guidelines

## Structure and Format
- Recipes are written in Markdown (.mdc) files with YAML frontmatter
- Frontmatter requires:
  - `description`: Concise single-sentence summary of recipe purpose
  - `globs`: File patterns this recipe applies to (use empty array for general recipes)
  - `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if recipe should always be applied
- Main content should follow a consistent structure:
  1. Overview (what this recipe accomplishes)
  2. Prerequisites (tools/knowledge needed)
  3. Step-by-step instructions (numbered lists)
  4. Expected outcomes
  5. Troubleshooting (common issues and solutions)
- Use code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting for commands or code examples

## Naming Convention
Follow the established pattern defined in `000-core-_R__-rules.mdc`. For recipes specifically:
- Use the same [NNN]-[core-][CRUD]-[name].mdc format
- Choose appropriate CRUD markers for the type of operation the recipe covers
- Use descriptive, specific names that clearly indicate the recipe's purpose

## Writing Best Practices
- Use imperative language for instructions ("Create a file" not "A file should be created")
- Be precise about commands and file paths
- Include verification steps to confirm success
- Provide expected output examples where applicable
- For complex recipes, break into logical sections with clear headings
- Reference related recipes or documentation when relevant
- Keep recipes focused on a single task or workflow
- Explain "why" along with "how" for non-obvious steps

## Recipe Maintenance
- Review recipes periodically to ensure they remain current
- Test recipes to verify they still work as documented
- Update recipes when dependencies or processes change
- Add troubleshooting tips based on common user issues
- Adjust priority numbers to reflect changing importance
- Remove or archive obsolete recipes
- Version control all recipe changes

## Organization Tips
- Group related recipes in thematic subdirectories
- Create index recipes that provide an overview of a category
- Use consistent terminology across recipes
- Consider including tags in frontmatter for improved searchability
- For complex workflows, create a master recipe that links to component recipes
