# Cursor Rules Guidelines

## Structure and Format
- Rules are written in Markdown (.mdc) files with YAML frontmatter
- Frontmatter requires:
  - `description`: Concise single-sentence summary of rule purpose
  - `globs`: File patterns this rule applies to (use empty array for general rules)
  - `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if rule should always be applied
- Main content should be structured with clear headings and bulleted lists
- Use code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting when including code examples

## Naming Convention
Follow the established pattern defined in `000-core-_R__-rules.mdc`. For cursor rules specifically:
- Apply the same [NNN]-[core-][CRUD]-[name].mdc format consistently
- Choose appropriate CRUD markers based on whether the rule provides guidance for creating, reading, updating, or deleting code
- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the rule's purpose and scope

## Writing Best Practices
- Be concise and specific
- Focus on actionable guidance over general principles
- Provide reasoning behind recommendations
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Cross-reference related rules when applicable
- Limit rule scope - create multiple focused rules rather than one massive rule
- Use imperative voice for instructions

## Rule Maintenance
- Review rules periodically to ensure they remain current
- Update `globs` as the codebase structure evolves
- Adjust priority numbers as needed to reflect changing importance
- Consolidate overlapping rules
- Split overly complex rules into multiple focused ones
- Remove obsolete rules rather than just commenting them out
- When updating a rule, ensure the description accurately reflects the new content
- Version control all rule changes as you would code changes

## Organization Tips
- Group related rules in subdirectories
- Create index rules that provide overview of rule categories
- Refer to `000-core-_R__-rules.mdc` for priority number ranges and their meanings
