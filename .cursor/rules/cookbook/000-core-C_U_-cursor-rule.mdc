# Cursor Rules Guidelines

## Core Principles
- **Extreme conciseness**: Eliminate all unnecessary words
- **Actionable**: Focus only on practical guidance
- **Structured**: Use clear headings and bullet points
- **Imperative**: Use direct commands

## Format
- Markdown (.mdc) with YAML frontmatter:
  - `description`: Single-sentence summary
  - `globs`: File patterns or [] for general rules
  - `alwaysApply`: Boolean
- Follow naming pattern: [NNN]-[core-][CRUD]-[name].mdc

## Writing Guidelines
- Delete all unnecessary words and sections
- Prefer bullets over paragraphs
- Use active voice, imperative mood
- Consolidate related points
- Include only essential examples
- Simplify complex concepts
- Eliminate redundancy

## Shell Commands
- Non-interactive only
- Add `| cat` to prevent paging
- Test all commands before adding
- Prefer succinct one-liners when possible

## Organization
- Split large rules into focused small ones
- Group related rules in subdirectories
