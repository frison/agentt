# Cursor Rules Guidelines

## Structure and Format
- Rules are written in Markdown (.mdc) files with YAML frontmatter
- Frontmatter requires:
  - `description`: Concise single-sentence summary of rule purpose
  - `globs`: File patterns this rule applies to (use empty array for general rules)
  - `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if rule should always be applied
- Main content should be structured with clear headings and bulleted lists
- Use code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting when including code examples

## Naming Convention
Follow the established pattern: `[NNN]-[core-][CRUD]-[name].mdc`
- **NNN**: Priority number (000-999, lower = higher priority)
- **core-**: Include for repository-agnostic rules
- **CRUD**: Which operations the rule addresses:
  - C = Create (guidance for new implementations)
  - R = Read (how to understand existing patterns)
  - U = Update (how to modify existing code)
  - D = Delete (when/how to remove components)
  - _ = Not applicable
- **name**: Brief, descriptive kebab-case name

## Writing Best Practices
- Be concise and specific
- Focus on actionable guidance over general principles
- Provide reasoning behind recommendations
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Cross-reference related rules when applicable
- Limit rule scope - create multiple focused rules rather than one massive rule
- Use imperative voice for instructions

## Rule Maintenance
- Review rules periodically to ensure they remain current
- Update `globs` as the codebase structure evolves
- Adjust priority numbers as needed to reflect changing importance
- Consolidate overlapping rules
- Split overly complex rules into multiple focused ones
- Remove obsolete rules rather than just commenting them out
- When updating a rule, ensure the description accurately reflects the new content
- Version control all rule changes as you would code changes

## Organization Tips
- Group related rules in subdirectories
- Create index rules that provide overview of rule categories
- Use priority numbers strategically:
  - 000-099: Foundational principles
  - 100-499: General patterns and practices
  - 500-899: Specific domains/components
  - 900-999: Temporary or transitional guidance
