# Add Git Commit Provenance to Blog Article

## Prerequisites
- Article committed to git in blog/content/
- [Git History Preservation](850-core-C_U_-git-history-preservation.mdc)

## Steps
1. Get article creation commit SHA:
   ```bash
   COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
   ```

2. Add to frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   provenance:
     repo: "https://github.com/frison/agentt"
     commit: "${COMMIT_SHA}"
   ```

3. Append to article:
   ```markdown
   ---

   *This article was originally created in commit [`${COMMIT_SHA}`](https://github.com/frison/agentt/commit/${COMMIT_SHA}).*
   ```

4. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add blog/content/your-article.md
   git commit -m "docs(blog): add provenance information"
   ```

## Validation
- Provenance points to article creation commit
- Links use absolute URLs
- Original commit SHA preserved
- Provenance statement isolated from content
