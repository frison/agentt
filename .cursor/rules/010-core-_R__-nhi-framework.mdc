# NHI Framework: Principles → Directives → Actions

## Framework Overview
- Three hierarchical tiers:
  1. **Principles** (the "why") - Foundational values and reasoning
  2. **Directives** (the "what") - Structural patterns and guidelines that guide mutations
  3. **Actions** (the "how") - Operational practices for causing mutations
- Always process in order: principles → directives → actions
- Higher tiers override lower tiers in conflicts

## Universal Discovery
```bash
# Discovery commands for all tiers
.nhi/tools/discover.sh .nhi/principles/[type] table  # [type]: universal, disciplines, etc.
.nhi/tools/discover.sh .nhi/directives table
.nhi/tools/discover.sh .nhi/actions table
```

## Tier 1: Principles
- STOP - Check `.nhi/principles/` before proceeding
- Universal principles (highest priority) override all other guidance
- Priority 1 principles (e.g., "Safety First") must be followed without exception
- Read principles completely, understand implications and interactions

## Tier 2: Directives
- STOP - Check `.nhi/directives/` for task-relevant guidance
- Follow explicit rules and resolve all references
- Apply by priority (lower number = higher priority)
- Binding directives must be followed without exception
- Verify alignment with principles during implementation

## Tier 3: Actions
- STOP - Check for specific action patterns before implementation
- Follow patterns exactly as written without substitution
- For complex operations, review complete pattern before starting
- Adapt your approach to tool limitations, not vice versa

## High-Risk Areas (Extra Scrutiny)
- User data, security, input validation, error handling
- Authentication/authorization, deployment, shared infrastructure

## Framework Evolution
- Prioritize newer guidance when principles change
- Document adaptations made during transitions
