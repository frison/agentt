# NHI Framework: Needs → Practices

## Framework Overview
- Two hierarchical tiers:
  1. **Needs** (`.nhi/needs/`) - Non-negotiable requirements, constraints, core values (the "why" and "musts").
  2. **Practices** (`.nhi/practices/`) - Guidance, patterns, procedures for implementation (the "how").
- Always process in order: needs → practices
- Needs override Practices in conflicts.

## Universal Discovery
```bash
# Discovery commands for all tiers
.nhi/tools/discover.sh .nhi/needs table
.nhi/tools/discover.sh .nhi/practices table
```

## Tier 1: Needs
- STOP - Check `.nhi/needs/` before proceeding.
- These define absolute constraints and fundamental requirements.
- Priority 1 needs (e.g., "Safety First") must be followed without exception.
- Read relevant needs completely, understand implications and interactions.
- Ensure fundamental compliance before considering practices.

## Tier 2: Practices
- STOP - Check `.nhi/practices/` for task-relevant guidance after verifying needs.
- These provide standard patterns, procedures, and guidelines.
- Follow explicit rules and patterns relevant to the task.
- Apply by priority (lower number = higher priority).
- Verify alignment with needs during implementation.
- Adapt your approach to tool limitations, not vice versa.

## High-Risk Areas (Extra Scrutiny)
- Areas often governed by critical `Needs` (User data, security, etc.)
- Always re-verify relevant `Needs` when working in these areas.
- Authentication/authorization, deployment, shared infrastructure.

## Framework Evolution
- Prioritize newer guidance when needs or practices change.
- Document adaptations made during transitions.
