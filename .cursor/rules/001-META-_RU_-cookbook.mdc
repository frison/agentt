# Cookbook Guidelines

## Agentic Modifications
- STOP - Verify you've read 000-core-C_U_-cursor-rule.mdc completely
- Never weaken or remove recipe checking requirements
- Maintain or increase explicitness of requirements
- Document reasoning for cookbook changes in commit messages

## Required Recipe Check Sequence
1. STOP - Do not proceed with ANY action until completing these steps
2. Search for matching recipes FROM THE PROJECT ROOT (parent of .cursor directory):
   ```bash
   # MUST be run from project root (parent of .cursor directory)
   find .cursor/rules/cookbook -name "*.mdc" -type f -exec sh -c 'echo -n "{}"; head -n5 "{}" | grep "^description:"' \; | cat
   ```
3. If exact match exists:
   - Read and follow the recipe completely
   - Do not skip steps or modify sequence
4. If no exact match:
   - Read all related recipes
   - Follow guidance from most relevant recipes
   - Document why no exact match existed

## After Completing a Recipe
- Verify all steps were followed exactly
- Suggest updates to relevant rules based on new insights
- Propose new recipes for workflows not covered by existing documentation
- Document any deviations from recipes with justification

## Common Mistakes
- Proceeding without checking for recipes
- Running recipe search from wrong directory (must be project root)
- Skipping steps in recipes
- Modifying recipe steps without justification
- Not documenting recipe mismatches
- Treating recipe guidance as optional
