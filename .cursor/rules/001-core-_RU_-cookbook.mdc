# Cookbook Guidelines

## First Steps
- Find a matching recipe for your request
  - Check recipe descriptions: `find recipe -name "*.mdc" -type f -exec sh -c 'echo -n "{}"; head -n5 "{}" | grep "^description:"' \;`
- If no match exists, review related recipes for guidance

## After Completing a Recipe
- Suggest updates to relevant rules based on new insights
- Propose new recipes for workflows not covered by existing documentation
