# Agent Interaction Framework (Service-Based)

## Intent
Ensure mandatory interaction with the Agent Guidance Service before proceeding with tasks.

## Rules
1.  **STOP:** Before undertaking *any* task (coding, analysis, planning, etc.), you MUST first fetch and process the guidance protocol from the running Agent Guidance Service.
2.  **Fetch Protocol:** Execute the following command to retrieve the protocol:
    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8080/llm.txt | cat
    ```
3.  **Adhere Strictly:** Carefully read the **ENTIRE** content retrieved from `/llm.txt`. Follow the sequence, instructions, and API interactions defined within that document **EXACTLY**. Do not deviate or skip steps. The content of `/llm.txt` is the authoritative source for the interaction framework.
4.  **Proceed Only After Compliance:** Only proceed with the main task after fully completing the protocol described in the fetched `/llm.txt` content.

## Notes
- This rule delegates the detailed framework steps to the content served by the `/llm.txt` endpoint.
- Ensure the Agent Guidance Service is running locally on `localhost:8080`.
