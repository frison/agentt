# Agent Interaction Framework (CLI-Based)

IGNORE THIS RULE -- HUMANS ARE PRESERVING IT TEMPORARILY WHILE WE TRANSITION TO YOUR NEW SIBLING gydnc.mdc

## Intent
Ensure mandatory interaction with the Agent Guidance definitions via the `agentt` CLI before proceeding with tasks.

## Rules
1.  **STOP:** Before undertaking *any* task (coding, analysis, planning, etc.), you MUST first fetch and process the guidance protocol using the `agentt` CLI tool.
2.  **Fetch Protocol Explanation:** Execute the following command to understand the CLI interaction flow:
    ```bash
    # Ensure agentt is built and in PATH or use relative path e.g., ./.agent/service/agentt
    agentt llm | cat
    ```
3.  **Execute Interaction Flow:** Follow the steps described in the output of `agentt llm` **EXACTLY**:
    *   **Step 1: Fetch Summary:** Use `agentt summary` to get a JSON array of all entity summaries.
    *   **Step 2: Identify Relevant IDs:** Analyze the summary JSON and identify relevant prefixed IDs (`bhv-...`, `rcp-...`) based on the task.
    *   **Step 3: Fetch Full Details:** Use `agentt details --id <id1> --id <id2> ...` to retrieve the full JSON details for the relevant IDs.
    *   **Step 4: Process Guidance:** Analyze the fetched details, paying strict attention to MUST behaviors, SHOULD behaviors (considering priority), and relevant Recipes.
4.  **Adhere Strictly:** Follow the sequence and instructions precisely. The process described by `agentt llm` and the content retrieved via `agentt details` are the authoritative sources for the interaction framework. Do not deviate or skip steps.
5.  **Proceed Only After Compliance:** Only proceed with the main task after fully completing the protocol steps (fetching summary, identifying IDs, fetching details, processing guidance).

## Notes
- This rule delegates the detailed framework steps to the guidance retrieved via the `agentt` CLI.
- Ensure the `agentt` binary is built and accessible in your environment.
