# Check Recipes First

## Core Principle
- **Always search for relevant recipes before performing operations**
- Especially critical for Git operations, imports, and file system modifications
- **Always check shell command guidelines** before running any terminal commands

## Process
1. When receiving a request:
   - First check if a relevant recipe exists
   - Search for keywords in the cookbook directory
   - For Git operations, explicitly check `000-core-C_U_-git-history-preservation.mdc`
   - For terminal commands, explicitly check `004-core-C_U_-shell-commands.mdc`

2. Key recipes to check:
   - Git operations: `000-core-C_U_-git-history-preservation.mdc`
   - Creating rules: `000-core-C_U_-cursor-rule.mdc`
   - Shell commands: `004-core-C_U_-shell-commands.mdc`
   - New recipes: `001-core-C_U_-recipe.mdc`

3. Critical elements to preserve:
   - **SOURCE_URL**: Always use the exact URL provided by the human
   - Follow specific sequence of steps outlined in recipes
   - Never skip prerequisite checks
   - **For terminal commands**: Always append `| cat` to any command that might use a pager

## Common Mistakes
- Proceeding without checking recipes
- Using simplified versions of operations
- Using incorrect URLs from what human provided
- Skipping verification steps
- Not following the exact procedures in recipes
- **Running commands without `| cat` appended to prevent interactive prompts**
- **Not checking the shell commands guidelines before executing terminal operations**
