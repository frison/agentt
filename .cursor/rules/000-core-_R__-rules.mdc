# Cursor Rules Naming Convention

Files are named using this pattern:

```
[NNN]-[core-][CRUD]-[name].mdc
```

Where:
- **NNN**: Priority number (lower = higher priority)
- **core-**: (Optional) Indicates repository-agnostic rules
- **CRUD**: Which operations are documented (C=Create, R=Read, U=Update, D=Delete, _=Not applicable)
- **name**: Brief description of the rule content. If a rules directory, it describes the directory.

## Examples:
- `000-core-_RU_-structure.mdc`: High-priority core rule about structure (Read/Update)
- `001-core-C_U_-recipe.mdc`: Recipe creation and updating documentation
- `020-CRU_-api-endpoints.mdc`: Repository-specific API endpoint documentation
