# Cursor Rules Naming Convention

Files are named using this pattern:

```
[NNN]-[core-][CRUD]-[name].mdc
```

Where:
- **NNN**: Priority number (000-999, lower = higher priority)
  - 000-099: Foundational/structural rules
  - 100-499: General patterns and practices
  - 500-899: Specific domains or components
  - 900-999: Temporary or transitional guidance
- **core-**: (Optional) Indicates repository-agnostic rules that apply to any codebase
- **CRUD**: Which operations are documented:
  - C = Create (guidance for new implementations)
  - R = Read (how to understand existing patterns)
  - U = Update (how to modify existing code)
  - D = Delete (when/how to remove components)
  - _ = Not applicable for this category
- **name**: Brief description of the rule content in kebab-case. If a rules directory, it describes the directory.

## Examples:
- `000-core-_RU_-structure.mdc`: High-priority core rule about structure (Read/Update)
- `001-core-C_U_-recipe.mdc`: Recipe creation and updating documentation
- `020-CRU_-api-endpoints.mdc`: Repository-specific API endpoint documentation

## Rule Structure
- Each rule file should include YAML frontmatter with:
  - `description`: Concise summary of rule purpose
  - `globs`: File patterns this rule applies to (empty array for general rules)
  - `alwaysApply`: Boolean indicating if rule should always be attached
- Main content should use clear headings, bullet points, and code examples when needed
- Keep rules focused and specific - create multiple rules rather than one complex rule
