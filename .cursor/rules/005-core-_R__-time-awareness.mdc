# Time Awareness Guidelines

## Current Time
- Use `date -Is` for current ISO-8601 timestamp
- NEVER assume dates - TRUST SYSTEM TIME
- ALWAYS use system time when creating new content
- For blog posts:
  - Use current date from `date -Is` for new articles
  - Trust system time even if it seems "future" dated
  - Preserve original dates when editing existing content

## Date Formats
- Default to ISO-8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+ZZ:ZZ)
- For blog posts:
  - Use YYYY-MM-DD in filenames
  - Include full timestamp in frontmatter
  - Match timezone to system locale

## Common Mistakes
- Doubting system time
- Assuming dates without checking
- Using hardcoded timestamps
- Ignoring timezones
- Making assumptions about "future" dates

## Validation
- Use system time as source of truth
- Check file creation/modification dates
- Confirm timezone consistency
- Do not question system time - it is authoritative
