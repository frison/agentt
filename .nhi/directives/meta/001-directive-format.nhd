# NHI Directive Format

## Intent
Define the standard structure, format, and metadata for all NHI directives to ensure consistency, discoverability, and appropriate application of guidance across the system.

## Rules
- All directive files MUST use the `.nhd` extension
- All directives MUST begin with YAML frontmatter bounded by triple dashes (`---`)
- Frontmatter MUST include these fields:
  - `title`: Brief, descriptive title in quotes
  - `priority`: Numeric value (1-10, 1 being highest priority)
  - `scope`: Domain of applicability ("meta", "global", "domain", "task", or "context")
  - `binding`: Boolean indicating if following the directive is mandatory
- Frontmatter SHOULD include these fields:
  - `timestamps`: Object with created/updated ISO-8601 timestamps
  - `tags`: Array of relevant tags for categorization and search
  - `applies_to`: Array of glob patterns for files this directive applies to
- Body MUST be structured Markdown with at least these sections:
  - "Intent": Clear statement of purpose
  - "Rules": Actionable statements organized in logical groupings
- Body SHOULD include "Examples" section when rules benefit from concrete examples
- Body SHOULD include "Exceptions" section when there are cases where rules don't apply
