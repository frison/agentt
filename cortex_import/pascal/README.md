# Pascal

Pascal is an Algol-inspired structured programming language that had a great deal of success in the 1970s and 80s before eventually being displaced by C and C++.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)):

> Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring. It is named after French mathematician, philosopher and physicist Blaise Pascal.
>
> Pascal was developed on the pattern of the ALGOL 60 language. Wirth was involved in the process to improve the language as part of the ALGOL X efforts and proposed a version named ALGOL W. This was not accepted, and the ALGOL X process bogged down. In 1968, Wirth decided to abandon the ALGOL X process and further improve ALGOL W, releasing this as Pascal in 1970. 

Borland's [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal), in particular, saw extensive use throughout the 80s and early 90s in both professional and educational settings by extending the language to incorporate features such as inline assembly, units for shipping code modules, and object-oriented programming features, among others.

Here we use a limited installation of [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/), a compiler supporting a variety of Pascal dialects, to build a simple example program.  Note, the resulting container only includes the core RTL.
