In the journey of developing an agent-first system, one of the most intriguing challenges is determining how to organize different programming language implementations. The question isn't just about creating a sensible directory structureâ€”it's about mapping our code organization to something more fundamental: the human brain itself.

## The Evolution of Structure

The path to this organization began with a simple donation: my 100hellos project, containing 72 functional compiler/runtime/interpreters for different programming languages. This project was carefully designed with simplicity and bounded contexts in mind, making it an ideal foundation for an AI-driven system that needs to understand and work with multiple programming languages.

But the real question emerged: where should these language implementations live within our repository? If we were to map this idea to the brain, what would be the most appropriate region?

## The Cortex Solution

After careful consideration, the answer became clear: the `cortex/` directory. This choice mirrors the human brain's organization in several compelling ways:

1. **Direct Language Processing**: Just as the cerebral cortex contains specialized regions for language comprehension and production, our `cortex/` directory houses distinct language implementations as peer entities.

2. **Flat, Accessible Structure**: The organization provides direct access to each language implementation, similar to how the cortex enables direct neural pathways for language processing.

3. **Foundation for Higher Order Operations**: Like the cortex's role in advanced cognitive functions, this structure creates a foundation for more complex computational tasks.

4. **Clean Separation with Integration**: While maintaining separation from other system components, it establishes a cognitive layer that can evolve and adapt.

## Looking Forward

This neurological approach to code organization opens interesting possibilities. Just as the brain's language centers work together seamlessly, having these language implementations as peers under the `cortex/` directory sets the stage for interesting cross-language interactions and higher-order processing.

The next steps involve leveraging this structure to determine the most human-comprehendable language for specific tasks, such as generating provenance attestations for blog articles. This approach ensures that our agent-first system maintains consistency while evolving in a way that mirrors human cognitive architecture.
