In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, we've hit upon a fascinating pattern - a loop that demonstrates the power of self-improving automation. Today's commit marks an important milestone in understanding how we can create systems that get better through their own execution.

## The Power of Context

The key insight from our recent work revolves around prompt engineering and temporal context. When building automated systems, especially those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), the quality of input directly correlates to the quality of output. We've discovered that commit messages serve as an ideal source of context - they're concise, focused, and carry the intent of changes.

## The Evolution Loop

The real magic happens when we use commit messages as input to the LLM. This creates a fascinating feedback loop:

1. Make changes to the system
2. Commit with detailed context
3. Feed that context back to the LLM
4. LLM uses this to make better decisions
5. Repeat

This isn't just automation - it's automation that learns from its own history and evolution.

## Why This Matters

When you have automation in place, using the commit message as input to the LLM (ideally, as the primary input outside of your rules) creates a powerful self-improving cycle. Each iteration potentially improves the system's understanding and capabilities.

## Looking Forward

This loop demonstrates rapid self-evolution and delivery. It's a pattern that could be applied to various aspects of software development, from code generation to documentation, from testing to deployment strategies.

The key is maintaining the quality of commit messages and ensuring they capture not just what changed, but why the change was made and what we learned from it.
