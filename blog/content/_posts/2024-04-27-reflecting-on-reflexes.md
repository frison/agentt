What happens when you set out to build simple, containerized tools with an AI partner? You embark on a fascinating journey of refinement, debugging, and discovery! Over the last little while, we've been developing a concept called "Reflexes," and this post chronicles that evolution, showcasing how human intuition and AI execution can collaborate to build something robust.

## The Spark: Needing Deterministic Tools ‚ú®

The core idea, born from conversations and captured in scratchpads like [`human_scratch_pad_reflexes_1.md`](/human_scratch_pad_reflexes_1.md), was simple: create small, **deterministic**, **containerized** units of functionality. Think of them like pure functions, but packaged as Docker images.

Key principles emerged:

*   **Build-time Freedom vs. Runtime Purity:** Do whatever you need at build time (install, compile), but the runtime container must be self-contained, requiring no external network calls.
*   **Defined Interface:** Clear inputs (env vars, mounted files/dirs) and outputs (stdout, mounted files/dirs).
*   **Idempotency (where applicable):** Running it twice with the same input yields the same output.

## The Manifest: Self-Documenting Reflexes üìú

How do you know how to use a reflex? We didn't want users (human or AI) digging through Dockerfiles. The solution: a mandatory `/manifest.yml` inside each reflex image.

This YAML file defines:

*   **Metadata:** Name, version, description.
*   **Inputs:** Required/optional environment variables (`environment:`), expected input mount points (`input_paths:`).
*   **Outputs:** Expected output format (`stdout:`), output mount points (`output_paths:`).

This makes each reflex self-documenting. We even built a helper tool to parse this manifest and provide usage instructions!

(Initially, the manifest structure was a bit nested, but we refactored it based on clarity principles for a flatter, more explicit structure ‚Äì a great example of iterative improvement during development!)

## The Helper: `nhi-entrypoint-helper` üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To standardize the execution and interface, we created a Go-based entrypoint helper (`nhi-entrypoint-helper`). This tool became the standard `ENTRYPOINT` for reflexes.

Its job:

1.  Parse `/manifest.yml`.
2.  Handle `-h`/`--help` flags, printing usage derived from the manifest.
3.  Handle `SHOW_MANIFEST=true` to print the raw manifest.
4.  **Validate Inputs/Outputs:** Check if required env vars are set and mounted paths exist *before* running the reflex's core logic.
5.  **Set up Environment:** Export environment variables based on validated mount paths (e.g., `INPUT_CONTENT=/app/input_content`).
6.  **Execute:** Run the actual command specified by the user (e.g., `python main.py`, `/app/process.sh`).

The helper itself went through several refinements:

*   **Logging:** Switched from basic `fmt.Fprint` to structured logging (`slog`) for clearer output.
*   **Environment Variables:** Ensured variables set by the helper (like `INPUT_CONTENT`) were correctly exported and available to the child process (`exec` in `sh -c` has nuances!).
*   **Permissions:** Debugged tricky volume permission issues related to Docker creating host directories as root vs. the container running as a non-root user (`docker run --user`). We ultimately confirmed that relying on `docker run --user` passed by our `bin/run` script was the canonical way, ensuring the helper *started* with the right permissions.

## Putting it Together: The `template` and `jekyll-site` Reflexes üß©

*   **`template`:** A simple Python reflex was built as an early example, taking text via an environment variable, processing it (e.g., doubling characters), and printing to stdout.
*   **`jekyll-site`:** This was a more complex reflex designed to build this very blog! It takes markdown content and config files as input (`input_paths`) and outputs a static site (`output_paths`).

Building the `jekyll-site` reflex involved its own mini-journey:

*   **Base Images:** Ensuring we used the correct, locally built `cortex/ruby:local` base image.
*   **Theme Overrides:** Creating custom `_layouts/default.html` and `assets/css/style.scss` in the `blog/content` input directory to give the blog its unique, collaborative look and feel.
*   **CSS Path Woes:** Debugging why the CSS wasn't applying correctly (initially using direct relative paths, then `relative_url` incorrectly, finally landing on `relative_url` with a leading slash `/` combined with `baseurl: ""` in `_config.yml`).
*   **Post Location:** Moving the existing blog markdown files into the conventional `_posts` directory so Jekyll would process them correctly for the index page.

## Looking Forward: Collaboration in Action ‚ú®

This whole process, from defining the reflex concept to debugging CSS paths, perfectly illustrates the power of human-AI collaboration. The AI handles rapid implementation, code generation, and consistency checks, while the human provides architectural direction, debugging intuition (like spotting the root-owned directory!), and ensures the output aligns with broader project goals and conventions.

The `manifest.yml` and `nhi-entrypoint-helper` provide a solid foundation for building more complex, reliable, and **understandable** containerized tools.

What reflexes will we build next? Stay tuned!
