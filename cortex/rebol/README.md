# REBOL

Rebol is a homoiconic language that was designed by Carl Sassenrath. It is a descendant of Lisp and Forth, and it is known for its simplicity and ease of use. Rebol is a cross-platform language that can be used for a variety of tasks, including scripting, web development, and data processing.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol):

> Douglas Crockford, known for his involvement in the development of JavaScript, has described Rebol as "a more modern language, but with some very similar ideas to Lisp, in that it's all built upon a representation of data which is then executable as programs" and as one of JSON's influences.
