# Crystal

Crystal is an object-oriented programming language intended to bring Ruby-style syntax to a compiled language with static type checking.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_(programming_language)):

> With syntax inspired by the language Ruby, it is a compiled language with static type-checking, but specifying the types of variables or method arguments is generally unneeded. Types are resolved by an advanced global type inference algorithm.

The included sample program demonstrates the definition of a class, basic object instantiation, and a simple method call.
