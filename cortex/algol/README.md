# ALGOL

Algorigthmic Language (ALGOL) is a family of imperative computer programming languages originally developed in the mid-1950s. It introduced code blocks and the `begin...end` pairs for delimiting them.

This is container has an implementation of ALGOL 60 from [JvanKatwijk](https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/algol-60-compiler) that converts Algol 60 to C, and then builds the C program. Your milage may vary with this implementation, but we're lucky it exists at all!
