# Forth

Forth is a stack-based, procedural programming language that finds heavy use in a variety of applications including various embedded systems ([Open Firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Firmware), for example, makes extensive use of Forth).  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)):

> Forth typically combines a compiler with an integrated command shell,[a] where the user interacts via subroutines called words. Words can be defined, tested, redefined, and debugged without recompiling or restarting the whole program. All syntactic elements, including variables, operators, and control flow, are defined as words. A stack is used to pass parameters between words, leading to a Reverse Polish Notation style. 

This container builds out version 0.7.3 of [Gforth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gforth), an actively maintained implementation of the ANS Forth standard.
