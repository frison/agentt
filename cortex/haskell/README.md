# Haskell

Inspired by, among others, [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML), and influencing languages like [F#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is a pure, functional programming language that's notable for its use of a lazily evaluated computational model, as well as for the introduction of [type classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class) and its use of [monads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) for handling side effects, particularly in the context of I/O.

While multiple implementations exist for the language, this example makes use of the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler) to build a simple example program.
