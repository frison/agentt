# D

The D language is a multi-paradigm systems programming language intended to be a superset of C and a replacement for C++.  As described in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)) on the language:

> D was designed with lessons learned from practical C++ usage, rather than from a purely theoretical perspective. Although the language uses many C and C++ concepts, it also discards some, or uses different approaches (and syntax) to achieve some goals. As such, it is not source compatible (nor does it aim to be) with C and C++ source code in general (some simpler code bases from these languages might by luck work with D, or require some porting). D has, however, been constrained in its design by the rule that any code that was legal in both C and D should behave in the same way.
