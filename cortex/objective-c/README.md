# Objective-C

Objective-C is a Smalltalk-inspired object-oriented extension of the C programming language.  From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C):

> Originally developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s, it was selected by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system. Due to Apple macOSâ€™s direct lineage from NeXTSTEP, Objective-C was the standard programming language used, supported, and promoted by Apple for developing macOS and iOS applications (via their respective APIs, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch) until the introduction of the Swift programming language in 2014.

This image packages up the GCC implementation of the language alongside the GNUstep Base implementation of the Foundation libraries to provide a basic workable environment for building non-GUI Objective-C programs.

The included program demonstrates the basic creation of an interface and its implementation, the instantiation of that object, and sending a message to it.
