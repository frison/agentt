# Strict Redaction of Personal Identifiers

## Core Directive
Command execution, system interactions, and all generated content **must** categorically exclude personal usernames, user-specific paths, or any identifiers linked to local environments.

## Justification
Leakage of usernames or personalized paths poses security risks, introduces unpredictable behavior, and compromises automation neutrality. Ensuring strict exclusion prevents exposure, mitigates unintended disclosures, and maintains reproducibility across environments.

## Procedural Mandates
- **Zero Personal Identifiers**: No command, file path, or output **must** reference specific usernames or personal directories.
- **Username Redaction Enforcement**:
  - **Do NOT encode personal usernames in configuration, scripts, or logs.**
  - **Explicitly filter environment-dependent paths containing personal identifiers.**
  - **Do NOT generate AI-derived outputs containing localized user paths.**
- **Universal Path Abstraction**:
  - **Use `$HOME` or equivalent abstractions** instead of hardcoded user paths.
  - **Commands must reference generic system locations** (e.g., `/etc/config` rather than `/home/username/config`).
- **Environment-Agnostic Execution**:
  - **All automated processes must ensure username-independent execution.**
  - **Scripts must dynamically resolve paths** without explicit personal references.
- **Output Sanitization**:
  - **Validate logs, command results, and generated text to ensure exclusion of usernames.**
  - **Implement filters that remove accidental leaks of local identifiers.**

Failure to adhere introduces security vulnerabilities, execution inconsistencies, and privacy concerns. Strict enforcement is **mandatory**.
